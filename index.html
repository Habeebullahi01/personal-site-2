    <h1>My Own Website.</h1>
    <h2>I'm Habeebullahi</h2>
    <p>I have learnt a little about building web pages, so I'm doing this to just try to polish that skill. I have been confused and making mistakes for a while now but I hope I'm able to perfect my ability.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="s2">
    <h2>Why I'm Doing This.</h2>
    <p>I'm not a web developer because it is part of my course requirements. I chose to do it as a hobby and because it is definitley going to help me later in the near future. I also took it up because according to some of the big-shots in the industry, programming teaches you how to think.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="s3">
    <h2>My Plan</h2>
    <p>I want to become a Full-Stack web developer like I said earlier. But I can't just be one by merely wanting. So I came up with a plan to help me. It may take a long time and will also be difficult and I would feel like giving up at times, but I'm just going to do what every great person has done,push through. When I finish the sections that are about front-end web development,which is just one part, I'll take on at least 10 practice projects from <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.frontendmentor.io">Frontendmentor.io</a> and finish them, and also design my own profile landing page. After all of these I will now proceed to the Back-end section. </p>
